            <g:title>Ground Grass-fed Wagyu Beef</g:title>
            <g:description>Wagyu beef (aka “Kobe” beef) is from a breed of cow specially raised to increase its
                percentage of fat marbling to consistently high levels. More marbling leads to more flavor, tenderness,
                and moisture as the fat melts during the cooking process. Thus, ground wagyu beef is more flavorful and
                moist than conventional beef. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grass-fed wagyu beef is almost unheard of in the
                beef market.&amp;nbsp; Hapani Wagyu Beef is free range (pasture raised) and 100% grass-fed/finished.&amp;nbsp;
                No hormones or antibiotics are ever used to promote growth.&amp;nbsp; Despite being raised without
                grain, it is still exquisitely marbled and produces fantastic ground beef. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Use
                this ground beef to make truly luxurious meals.&amp;nbsp; Its higher fat content will help ensure formed
                items like burgers, meatloaf &amp;amp; meatballs stay together and stay moist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not
                only is free range grass fed beef more humane, it’s better for you too.&amp;nbsp; 100% grass fed beef is
                lower in saturated fat as well as higher in valuable nutrients like vitamins A &amp;amp; E, conjugated
                linoleic acid (aka CLA), and omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

            <g:title>Wagyu Beef New York Strip Steaks</g:title>
            <g:description>NY strip steaks (aka country club steaks, ambassador steaks) are perhaps the most iconic
                steak-house cut, offering tender beef and a perfect showcase for traditional steak sauces. Strip steaks
                cut from Kobe beef take this meaty favorite to a new level by adding extra flavor and tenderness.&lt;br
                /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This wagyu beef (commonly known as &quot;Kobe beef&quot;, aka Kobe-style beef
                or Australian Kobe beef) is from Waygu cattle that are descendents from Japanese herds and raised in
                Australia. Their intricately marbled beef is legendary and the result of careful breeding and a highly
                regimented diet. That marbling creates beef that is the most tender, juicy, and flavorful available.&lt;br

            <g:title>Wagyu Bone-In Short Ribs</g:title>
            <g:description>Wagyu&amp;nbsp;short ribs (aka&amp;nbsp;Kobe beef&amp;nbsp;short ribs) are an affordable,
                meaty and well marbled cut high in collagen. When braised, this collagen (along with the marbled fat and
                gelatin from the bones) melts into the braising liquid, resulting in incredibly tender meat and a rich
                sauce. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people prefer the bone-in cut because they believe the bones offer
                additional flavor, help stabilize the meat during cooking so it doesn’t fall apart, and offer a more
                interesting look on the plate. Others feel that Kobe boneless short ribs are easier to eat, although the
                bones can be easily removed from this cut after cooking for a similar result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This&amp;nbsp;wagyu
                beef (commonly known as &quot;Kobe beef&quot;, aka Kobe-style beef or American Kobe beef) is from
                domestic Waygu (meaning &quot;Beef of Japan&quot;) cattle that are descendants from Japanese herds and
                raised in the United States. Their intricately marbled beef is legendary and the result of careful
                breeding and a highly regimented diet. That marbling creates beef that is the most tender, juicy, and
                flavorful available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:title>Wagyu Beef Boneless Short Ribs</g:title>
            <g:description>Many people like boneless short ribs better than bone-in short ribs because they feel they
                are easier to eat. Others prefer bone-in Kobe short ribs because they feel the bones keep the meat
                together during cooking and impart extra flavor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This wagyu beef is from

            <g:title>Wagyu Beef Ribeye Steaks</g:title>
            <g:description>Ribeye steaks are the quintessential high end steak, renowned for their intensely beefy
                flavor. This cut is a particularly striking showcase of wagyu beef&#x27;s extreme marbling, with high
                grade examples practically melting in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This wagyu beef (aka kobe-style
                beef) is from a breed of cattle descended from Japanese herds and specially raised in Texas to increase
                its percentage of fat marbling to consistently high levels. More marbling leads to more flavor,
                tenderness, and moisture as the fat melts during the cooking process. Thus, wagyu beef ribeye steaks are
                both more flavorful and more tender than those cut from conventional beef.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:title>Wagyu Inner Skirt Steaks</g:title>
            <g:description>Skirt steaks have a chewy texture that makes them less popular than the steakhouse cuts.
                However, this simply makes them more affordable, and they actually offer some of the richest flavor of
                all steaks. Their loose texture makes them particularly well suited to absorbing marinades. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
                /&gt;Inner skirt steaks are the traditional cut used in making fajitas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wagyu
                skirt steaks are inner skirt steaks rather than outer skirt steaks.  Most chefs prefer inner skirt
                steaks because they require much less trimming before cooking.  In addition, they have already been
                peeled (had the outer membrane removed), so they’re ready to cook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are from
                domestic waygu cattle that are descendants from Japanese herds and raised in the United States. Wagyu
                cattle’s intricately marbled beef (commonly known as Kobe beef, aka American Kobe beef or Kobe-style

            <g:description>The flank steak is a long, thin, flat cut that absorbs marinades extremely well. It has a
                bold, beefy flavor and a more chewy texture. It is most often cooked hot and fast using dry heat methods
                like grilling or broiling. Though skirt steaks are the traditional cut used for fajitas, you could also
                use flank steaks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grass Fed &amp;amp; Pasture Raised&lt;br /&gt; Silver Fern

                in New Zealand. No hormone or antibiotic growth promotants are ever used, and GMOs are illegal there.&lt;br
                /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because of New Zealand&#x27;s moderate climate, these cattle are pasture raised year
                round, with free access to windbreaks and other structures for shelter from inclement weather.&lt;br /&gt;

                and texture, with a grading system that ensures you get great beef every time. It has a clean, boldly
                beefy flavor without the heavy tallow characteristic of commodity beef. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Careful
                quality grading ensures it is consistently more marbled, tender, and flavorful than much of the
                grass-fed beef available in the US.(more...)

                tender.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is a smaller muscle located within the chuck roll, known as the

                that offers surprisingly good flavor and tenderness at a great price. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes
                this cut so affordable is that it requires a little butchery work before it can be cooked.  A layer of
                tough silverskin runs through the center of the flat iron, separating two sections of tender meat.  If
                you&#x27;re willing to do the butchery yourself (see the Recipes &amp;amp; Tips tab for a video guide),
                you can have flat iron steaks at a superb price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-cut, ready to cook flat iron
                steaks are also available, saving you all the work.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grass Fed &amp;amp; Pasture

            <g:title>Grass-fed Beef Top Round</g:title>
            <g:description>The economical top round cut is also very versatile. While it can be cut into steaks (called
                top round steaks or round steaks), it works extremely well in moist heat applications like stews,
                pot-roasts, and braised dishes. The Japanese often slice the top round extremely thin for use in
                simmered dishes like sukiyaki and shabu-shabu. It takes marinades well and can also be cooked whole for
                roast beef.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grass Fed &amp;amp; Pasture Raised&lt;br /&gt; Silver Fern Farms

            <g:title>Grass-Fed Beef Teres Majors</g:title>
            <g:description>The teres major (aka teras major,&amp;nbsp;petite tender, shoulder tender) is a&amp;nbsp;relatively&amp;nbsp;unheard
                of, but highly desirable cut.&amp;nbsp; Believe it or not, this muscle&amp;nbsp;may be&amp;nbsp;the
                second most tender cut after the tenderloin.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The reason why this is a
                comparatively “new” cut is that until recently it required a high level of butchery skill and experience
                to extract from the tougher shoulder muscles around it.&amp;nbsp; Now that a better process has been
                discovered, it is rapidly gaining popularity because it provides a more affordable alternative to the
                prized tenderloin.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not only do teres majors have a taste and texture similar to
                tenderloins, they’re similarly easy to cook.&amp;nbsp; You can either roast them whole or slice them&amp;nbsp;into
                medallions for sautéing or pan roasting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grass Fed &amp;amp; Pasture Raised&lt;br

            <g:description>The coulotte (aka round sirloin tip, sirloin cap, or rump cap) is not a familiar cut to most
                Americans, but is worth discovering. It is cut from the top portion or “cap” of the sirloin.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;The most marbled part of the sirloin, with a coarse structure, coulotte is surprisingly
                tender and flavorful. It is great grilled or roasted (where its fat cap will self-baste the meat,
                helping to keep it moist) and is particularly prized in Brazilian barbecue (where it is known as the
                picanha).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grass Fed &amp;amp; Pasture Raised&lt;br /&gt; Silver Fern Farms Angus

            <g:description>Located in the bottom of the round (rear leg) primal, the eye of round cut may resemble a
                tenderloin, but is better suited to slow roasting or moist heat cooking (stews and braises). &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;Silver Fern brand grass fed beef is raised on the pristine pastures of New Zealand.  With
                this beef, “grass fed” means 100% grass fed &amp;amp; grass finished.  Silver Fern beef has been
                produced according to strict EU mandated animal welfare conditions.  The cattle are pastured 100% of the
                time, with access to paddock areas with windbreaks and other structures for shelter from inclement
                weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beef is more marbled and flavorful than much of the grass fed beef
                available in the US.  Read Why Angus Beef is So Well Regarded and The Different Ways Cattle are Raised
                for more information about what makes it so special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is free range grass
                fed beef more humane, it’s better for you too.  100% grass fed beef is lower in saturated fat as well as
                higher in valuable nutrients like vitamins A &amp;amp; E, conjugated linoleic acid (aka CLA), and
                omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

                tender. Boneless short ribs can be more convenient and easier to eat than bone-in short ribs.&lt;br /&gt;

                program combines the Angus breed, renowned for superior marbling, flavor, and texture, with a grading
                system that ensures you get great beef every time. It has a clean, boldly beefy flavor without the heavy

            <g:title>Grass-fed Beef Bone In Short Ribs</g:title>
            <g:description>Short ribs are a classic braising cut.  High in collagen, they need to be cooked low and slow
                in order to make them tender, but the results are more than worth the wait.  When braised, all the
                collagen melts into the braising liquid, giving it a silky mouth feel and tremendous body.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;These grass fed beef short ribs are bone-in. Some people prefer the bone-in version of this
                cut because the bones offer additional flavor, help stabilize the meat during cooking so it doesn’t fall
                apart, and offer a more interesting look on the plate.  If desired the bones can be easily pulled from
                the short ribs after braising so you can serve them boneless.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grass Fed &amp;amp;

            <g:description>Bone-in whole ribeyes (aka export ribs) are the full (lip-on) muscle that ribeye steaks are
                cut from.  The included rib bones give the cut structure, a striking presentation, and are believed to
                provide additional flavor.  These ribeyes have been processed so that they can be roasted whole as a
                standing rib roast or easily sliced into individual ribeye steaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ribeye steaks
                and roasts have an excellent, boldly beefy flavor that makes them in high demand at top steak houses. 
                No fancy sauces are necessary – some salt and a few grinds of pepper are all a ribeye needs to shine.&lt;br

            <g:description>Hanger steaks (aka hanging tenders, butcher’s steaks, &quot;thick skirts&quot;, onglets) are
                cut from the plate, between the brisket &amp;amp; the flank. With a slightly chewy, stringy texture
                similar to skirt steaks, hanger steaks offer particularly full beefy, liver-y, almost game-meat-esque
                flavor.  Like skirt steaks, they work particularly well with marinades.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until
                recently hanger steaks were relatively unknown in the US - many American butchers kept them for
                themselves.  They’ve long been popular in Europe and are considered a classic French bistro cut.  Today
                they’re showing up on more and more restaurant menus as American chefs discover their beefy flavor and
                affordable price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grass Fed &amp;amp; Pasture Raised&lt;br /&gt; Silver Fern

            <g:title>Grass-fed Beef Oxtails</g:title>
            <g:description>Oxtails are a high-gelatin, flavorful, and affordable bone-in cut that are wonderful stewed
                or slow-braised until the meat is fork tender.  During cooking their gelatin melts into the broth,
                giving it rich body and a delightful mouth feel.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While oxtails are often sold
                pre-sliced into disks (that look like small osso bucco), these are actually whole oxtails that have had
                the tips trimmed off and some of the fat on the body-end removed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grass Fed
                &amp;amp; Pasture Raised&lt;br /&gt; Silver Fern Farms Angus beef is 100% grass-fed &amp;amp; finished,
                raised free range on massive, pristine pastures in New Zealand. No hormone or antibiotic growth
                promotants are ever used, and GMOs are illegal there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because of New Zealand&#x27;s
                moderate climate, these cattle are pasture raised year round, with free access to windbreaks and other
                structures for shelter from inclement weather.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Selected for Excellence&lt;br /&gt;
                Silver Fern Farms is a coop of small family farmers across New Zealand. The Angus program combines the
                Angus breed, renowned for superior marbling, flavor, and texture, with a grading system that ensures you
                get great beef every time. It has a clean, boldly beefy flavor without the heavy tallow characteristic

            <g:description>Ground beef (aka mince beef) is extremely versatile and can be turned into burgers,
                meatballs, meat loaf, meat sauce for pasta, chili, and more.&amp;nbsp; This ground beef has an 85%/15%
                lean/fat ratio and is ground from only solid muscle, so it has a superior texture to beef ground from
                cheaper trim.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grass Fed &amp;amp; Pasture Raised&lt;br /&gt; Silver Fern Farms

            <g:title>Reserve Grass-Fed Flat Irons</g:title>
            <g:description>Cut from the shoulder (chuck), the flat iron is a unique portion that is more tender than the
                surrounding muscle.  While flat iron meat is delicious – flavorful and quite tender - the muscle has a
                thick layer of silver skin running through it that must be removed before it can be enjoyed.  &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;Because they require more butchery than the prime steak cuts, flat irons offer great flavor
                &amp;amp; texture at a more affordable price.  For a video guide demonstrating how to clean a flat iron,
                click the “Recipes &amp;amp; Tips” tab. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Top 4% - Graded for Unparalleled

                Zealand produces, representing around the top 4% of production.  That makes it some of the very best
                grass-fed beef in the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Exceptionally tender and flavorful, this beef is

            <g:description>The striploin is the muscle typically cut into NY strip steaks and offers a good balance of
                flavor and tenderness.  Striploins can also be cooked whole as luxurious roasts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These
                striploins have had most of their tail meat and outer fat layer trimmed off for your convenience (1x1). 
                Because the butchery work has been done for you, it&amp;rsquo;s simple to slice them into steaks without
                much trimming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Top 4% - Graded for Unparalleled Quality&lt;br /&gt; Silver
                Fern Farms&amp;rsquo; 100% Grass-Fed Reserve Beef is amongst the finest beef New Zealand produces,

            <g:title>Bison Skirt Steaks</g:title>
            <g:description>Bison skirt steaks have a stringy, chewy texture that makes them less popular than the
                premium steak cuts. However, this simply makes them more affordable, and they actually offer some of the
                richest flavor of all steaks. Their loose texture makes them particularly well suited to absorbing
                marinades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Skirt steaks are the traditional cut used in making fajitas. Because
                of their long muscle fibers, they are best served thinly sliced against the grain.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bison&#x27;s&amp;nbsp;flavor
                is often described as a richer&amp;nbsp;version of beef&amp;nbsp;with just a hint of sweetness. It is
                not gamey at all, and has a deeper red color and coarser grain than beef.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like
                many game meats, bison meat is much healthier than conventional grain-fed beef. Its primary health
                benefits are its low fat content (less than a third as much fat as similar cuts of beef), lower
                cholesterol (less than skinless chicken) and high amount of iron. This makes it an ideal red meat choice
                for those concerned about eating heart healthy food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                steaks aren&#x27;t as tender as premium steaks like ribeyes and filet mignons, they&#x27;re generally

            <g:description>Hanger steaks are thick cuts of meat cut from the Plate, between the brisket &amp;amp; the
                flank. Until relatively recently the hanger steak was a cut most often found for sale in Europe, while
                most American butchers kept it for themselves. With a slightly chewy, stringy texture similar to bison
                skirt steaks, bison hanger steaks offer particularly bold flavor and are a great choice for marinating.&lt;br
                /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bison&#x27;s flavor is often described as a richer version of beef with just a hint of

            <g:title>Bison Burgers</g:title>
            <g:description>Bison burgers offer a healthier, more robust twist on the burger, with a bold flavor &amp;amp;
                less fat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bison&#x27;s flavor is often described as a richer version of
                beef with just a hint of sweetness. It is not gamey at all, and has a deeper red color and coarser grain
                than beef.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like many game meats, bison meat is much healthier than
                conventional grain-fed beef. Its primary health benefits are its low fat content (less than a third as
                much fat as similar cuts of beef), lower cholesterol (less than skinless chicken) and high amount of
                iron. This makes it an ideal red meat choice for those concerned about eating heart healthy food.&lt;br

            <g:title>Canadian Elk Striploin</g:title>
            <g:description>Elk striploins are cut from the saddle (back) and are one of the more tender elk meat cuts
                available.  They are suitable for roasting whole or slicing into individual steaks, noisettes (small
                steaks), or medallions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These striploins have had their surface layer of
                silverskin removed for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elk is considered by some people to
                offer the best flavor of all the venison game meats (deer meat, elk meat, antelope meat, moose, etc).
                When compared to deer meat and antelope meat, its flavor is on the beefier side, making it a great
                choice for stews and burgers. Because it’s very low in fat and cholesterol and high in zinc and iron,
                elk is a healthy alternative to beef.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:description>Stew meat cubes are cut from muscles that are too tough for quick cooking techniques like

            <g:title>Grass-Fed Lamb Burgers</g:title>
            <g:description>Looking for a break from beef burgers? Lamb is an excellent choice! Its robust flavor opens
                the door to a wide variety of exciting new seasonings, sauces, and toppings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These
                Crown Range brand burgers are made from premium ground Ovation lamb and vacuum packed 2-per pack. All
                you have to do is thaw, season, and sear or grill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do these patties make
                great burgers, but they can also be easily broken up &amp;amp; used as ground lamb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ovation
                lamb is 100% grass-fed &amp;amp; pasture raised free range in New Zealand. No hormone or antibiotic
                growth promotants are ever used, and GMOs are illegal in New Zealand. All cuts in this program are aged
                for 96 hours before blast freezing – longer than other lamb programs – in order to bring the lamb to the
                pinnacle of tenderness &amp;amp; flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grass-fed lamb is lower in saturated fat
                and higher in healthy vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) than grain-fed
                lamb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:title>Iberico Pork Back Fat</g:title>
            <g:description>Back fat (aka Iberico fat back) is creamy, sweet fat from the belly of the hog.&amp;nbsp; It
                can be used in a variety of applications: sausage making, making rillettes, barding (wrapping lean meat
                or poultry in fat to keep it moist during cooking), or curing to produce lardo, an Italian delicacy.
                &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Iberico back fat offers a significant flavor upgrade over conventional pork
                back fat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Iberico pork is a Spanish culinary treasure, amongst the finest pork
                in the world.&amp;nbsp; While iberico is best known for the famous slow-aged hams, the other cuts are
                succulent, moist &amp;amp; delicious.&amp;nbsp; This iberico pork is raised free range on traditional
                Spanish pastures known as dehesas.&amp;nbsp; It’s fed a natural diet of grain, corn, wheat, grass &amp;amp;
                forage.&amp;nbsp; No added growth hormones or sub-therapeutic antibiotics are ever used. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;Iberico pork raised in this way is considered “Campo Iberian Pork” under Spanish law, a term
                which requires that the animals are raised in the open air on an all-natural cereal-based diet. &lt;br /&gt;

            <g:description>The secreto is a small, hidden (“secret”) boneless cut from behind the shoulder. Tender,
                well-marbled &amp;amp; delicious, this is a great cut for quick cooking applications like searing or
                grilling.  It offers great flavor even when simply served seasoned with salt &amp;amp; pepper. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s cut from an entirely different part of the animal, secreto is
                sometimes referred to as “skirt steak” in the US, because it’s cooked similarly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Iberico

            <g:description>The intense marbling and tenderness of the Kurobuta pork makes it ideal for such an elegant
                cut as the rib rack. Rib racks (aka rack roast of pork) are a classic cut, and these racks are
                center-cut – you are only buying the thickest, most meaty part of the rack. Each rack can be separated
                into about eight rib chops before or after cooking.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kurobuta pork (aka Berkshire
                pork) is from a rare breed of pig that has long been bred in England and Japan for flavor and more
                marbled meat. The result is some of the finest pork in the world, sometimes referred to as &quot;The

                large pieces rather than slices.&amp;nbsp; This allows you to cut it to suit your tastes and needs.&lt;br
                /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kurobuta pork (aka Berkshire pork) is from a rare breed of pig that has long been bred
                in England and Japan for flavor and more marbled meat. The result is some of the finest pork in the
                world, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Kobe Beef of Pork.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Minimally

            <g:title>Kurobuta Pork St. Louis Spare Ribs</g:title>
            <g:description>While Kurobuta baby back ribs are cut from along the spine, spareribs are from around the
                belly, with meat somewhat similar to pork bellies.&amp;nbsp; Less sought after than baby backs (and
                consequently less expensive), spareribs are a higher fat, but also meatier alternative.&amp;nbsp;
                Spareribs are quite popular in European, Asian, and American barbecue recipes for their rich flavor.&lt;br
                /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These are St. Louis style spare ribs, meaning that the surrounding bones and cartilage
                have been removed to make them easier to eat (and so you’re paying for less bone). They&#x27;ve been
                trimmed to smaller, more uniform dimensions to make them easier to cook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kurobuta
                pork (aka Berkshire pork) is from a rare breed of pig that has long been bred in England and Japan for
                flavor and more marbled meat. The result is some of the finest pork in the world, sometimes referred to
                as “The Kobe Beef of Pork.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: While this cut is excellent for home use, we
                recommend purchasing whole Kurobuta spare rib racks instead for use&amp;nbsp;in competitive BBQ.&amp;nbsp;
                St. Louis ribs are cut from younger animals for more tender meat.&amp;nbsp; This also results in smaller
                racks that are easy for home cooks to handle, but are less impressive on the competitive circuit. St.
                Louis racks are (more...)

            <g:title>Kurobuta Pork Baby Back Ribs</g:title>
            <g:description>Shorter and meatier than the lower spare ribs, baby back ribs are often the rib lover’s pork
                rib of choice.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most conventional pork has been bred to have as little fat in the
                meat as possible. Kurobuta (Berkshire) pigs have instead been encouraged to have as much marbling as
                possible, which increases their moistness, tenderness, and flavor when cooked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Whether
                you like your ribs smoked, roasted, or braised, Kurobuta baby back ribs will yield truly delicious
                results&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:title>Rabbit Hind Leg Quarters</g:title>
            <g:description>Rabbit meat is tender, lean, and juicy, with a flavor somewhat similar to chicken, but
                richer.  Rabbit hind legs are the meatiest part of the animal and have a more robust flavor.  They are
                best prepared through slow-cooking techniques like braising, stewing or slow-roasting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br
                /&gt;Each leg quarter includes both the leg and the attached thigh.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Air chilling
                (as opposed to the cheaper and more common industrial water chilling) rabbits is a more environmentally
                sound process that generates less waste and further improves the flavor and texture of the meat (water
                chilled rabbits can absorb water during the chilling process).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These rabbits are
                raised by Grupo Hermi, a company that has been raising top quality rabbits in Spain for over 40 years.
                They control all aspects of production from breeding for superior genetics to innovative farming,
                processing &amp;amp; packaging. European chefs have very high standards when it comes to rabbit, and
                Grupo Hermi delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:title>Rabbit Bone-In Saddles</g:title>
            <g:description>Rabbit saddles are the main body of the rabbit, minus the legs and head. Saddle meat is
                particularly tender, with a mild and easily adaptable flavor somewhat similar to chicken, but richer.
                Like most game meats, it is low in fat, calories and cholesterol.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bone-in
                saddles offer more shape and structure than boneless rabbit saddles, and are commonly roasted whole in
                Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Air chilling (as opposed to the cheaper and more common industrial water

            <g:description>Le Québécois veal racks (aka medium veal hotel rack, chop ready) are delicious roasted whole
                or sliced into rib chops for faster searing, grilling, or roasting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grain-fed
                veal is not the same as ‘pale veal.’ Its natural rose color comes from a varied, nutritious diet,
                including grains, which give the meat a more robust flavor for two reasons: First, grains give the meat
                subtle marbling that infuses the meat with flavor and tenderness that veal is known for. Second,
                grain-fed veal contains more iron and other minerals which add to the delicious flavor and the animal’s
                health. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Le Québécois is the first veal program to combine USDA approved All
                Natural* status, humane animal husbandry, full traceability, and sustainable farming practices. &lt;br /&gt;

            <g:description>Whole veal tenderloins are usually sold cut into Grain-fed Veal Butt Tenders. and short
                tenders. By buying whole tenderloins you are getting both cuts in one piece of meat. Veal tenderloins
                are similar to beef tenderloins in that they are one of the animal’s most tender sections, but are
                milder in flavor. Because of this, veal tenderloins are best suited to being served with sauces. &lt;br
                /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, being veal instead of beef, these tenderloins will be even more tender.
                They have had their surface fat removed for your convenience.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grain-fed veal is
                not the same as ‘pale veal.’ Its natural rose color comes from a varied, nutritious diet, including

            <g:title>Grain-fed Veal Butt Tenders</g:title>
            <g:description>Though the term “butt” when referring to meat tends to evoke the upper part of pork shoulder,
                a fatty part of the animal, veal butt tenders are actually very different and quite lean. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;Traditionally veal tenderloins, the muscles on a cow that perhaps do the least amount of
                work, are divided into two sections: the smaller forward “short” and the larger rear “butt.” Because of
                the small amount of work during the animal’s lifetime, the tenderloin remains tender despite being
                extremely lean.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ideal for being cut into veal medallions, meat from the butt
                tender is a great way to showcase sauces.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grain-fed veal is not the same as
                ‘pale veal.’ Its natural rose color comes from a varied, nutritious diet, including grains, which give

                chop is similar to the t-bone, with a long bone running through the middle with the tenderloin on one
                side and the strip loin on the other.&amp;nbsp; You&#x27;re essentially enjoying two steaks in one: a

                porterhouse&amp;nbsp;steaks tend to average between 1 1/4&quot; and 1 1/2&quot;&amp;nbsp;thick.&amp;nbsp;
                However, they are portioned by weight rather than thickness, so this can vary.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grain-fed

            <g:title>Grain-fed Veal Liver Slices</g:title>
            <g:description>Calf’s liver is considered the finest of the red-meat livers available because of its smooth
                texture and mild flavor. As the liver is usually the organ where toxins and chemicals are stored, Le
                Québécois veal’s all natural status is particularly important when considering this product. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;Grain-fed veal is not the same as ‘pale veal.’ Its natural rose color comes from a varied,
                nutritious diet, including grains, which give the meat a more robust flavor for two reasons: First,
                grains give the meat subtle marbling that infuses the meat with flavor and tenderness that veal is known
                for. Second, grain-fed veal contains more iron and other minerals which add to the delicious flavor and
                the animal’s health.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Le Québécois is the first veal program to combine USDA
                approved All Natural* status, humane animal husbandry, full traceability, and sustainable farming
                practices. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Minimally Processed. No Artificial Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:title>Venison Stew Meat</g:title>
            <g:description>Venison stew meat is a mix of pre-cubed solid deer meat.&amp;nbsp; Though not suitable for
                grilling or sautéing, it is one of the most affordable ways to enjoy venison and becomes very tender and
                flavorful when slow braised or stewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venison is lean, naturally tender and
                darker than beef with a robust game flavor.&amp;nbsp; This stew meat can either be used in traditional
                venison dishes (like stews) or as a lower-fat beef substitute in chilies, goulash, stroganoff, and a
                host of other dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all farmed venison, New Zealand venison is particularly
                prized because that country’s deer farms adhere to exceptionally high standards of husbandry.&amp;nbsp;
                This stew meat is cut from New Zealand red deer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:title>Venison Boneless Shoulder</g:title>
            <g:description>Because venison shoulder meat can&#x27;t be prepared using quick cooking techniques like
                grilling or sauteing, it is much more affordable than popular cuts like racks and tenderloins.  However,
                with a little patience and a slow, moist cooking method like stewing or braising, it
                becomes delightfully tender and offers great flavor.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, venison
                shoulders can be cut into cubes and put through a meat grinder for use in burgers, sausages, meatballs
                and other ground meat dishes that can be cooked quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silver Fern Farms
                Venison is 100% grass-fed &amp;amp; finished, raised free range on massive pastures in New Zealand. No
                hormone or antibiotic growth promotants are ever used, and GMOs are illegal in New Zealand.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;It has a luxuriously tender texture (apart from the braising cuts, which must be slow
                cooked) and a sweet, robust flavor.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This farm raised venison is considered
                amongst the finest in the world. It is much more tender than wild venison without its intensely gamey
                flavor. The &quot;Cervena&quot; appellation includes controls to ensure only the finest quality is sold.&lt;br

            <g:title>Venison Boneless Denver Leg</g:title>
            <g:description>A Denver venison leg is all the muscles from a deboned deer hind leg that have been separated
                &amp;amp; cleaned of surface membranes. First the leg is separated into the four sub-primals (rump,
                knuckle, topside &amp;amp; silverside), then those sub-primals are split into the various muscles (1
                rump, 3 knuckle, 2 topside, 2 silverside) for a total of eight individual pieces.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What
                is surprising is that the quality of Silver Fern Farms venison is such that the cuts in the Denver leg
                are tender enough to be used in applications typically reserved for more expensive cuts: steaks,
                medallions, chateaubriand, etc.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Silver Fern Farms Venison is 100% grass-fed
                &amp;amp; finished, raised free range on massive pastures in New Zealand. No hormone or antibiotic
                growth promotants are ever used, and GMOs are illegal in New Zealand.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has a
                luxuriously tender texture (apart from the braising cuts, which must be slow cooked) and a sweet, robust
                flavor.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This farm raised venison is considered amongst the finest in the world.
                It is much more tender than wild venison without its intensely gamey flavor. The &quot;Cervena&quot;

            <g:description>The flank steak is a thin steak with a pronounced grain cut from around the belly and most
                often marinated before being either grilled or broiled.  Venison flank steaks can be prepared using
                these traditional methods, but are also often braised because they’re so lean compared to beef.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;Silver Fern Farms Venison is 100% grass-fed &amp;amp; finished, raised free range on massive
                pastures in New Zealand. No hormone or antibiotic growth promotants are ever used, and GMOs are illegal

                cuts, which must be slow cooked) and a sweet, robust flavor.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This farm raised
                venison is considered amongst the finest in the world. It is much more tender than wild venison without

                has extremely low levels of fat - significantly less than skinless chicken. It is also lower in
                cholesterol than beef or lamb, while being high in iron and zinc. What fat it has is good fat, with high
                levels of healthy omega 3 fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

            <g:title>Venison Osso Bucco</g:title>
            <g:description>Venison osso bucco is a low cost cut (relative to other parts of the deer) that consists of a
                disc of meat &amp;amp; bone cut horizontally from the shank (leg). Because leg muscles do a lot of work
                during the animal’s life time, shank meat offers great flavor but is too dense for fast cooking methods
                like sautéing, frying, or grilling.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, what makes osso bucco special is
                that the shank and leg bone are naturally high in gelatin, perfect for slow braising in a flavorful
                liquid. As the meat cooks it becomes rich and fork-tender, and all of that gelatin dissolves into the
                sauce, giving it body and a silky, decadent mouth feel.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although delicious year
                round, braising cuts like osso bucco are a particularly good choice for shaking off winter chills and
                doldrums.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Silver Fern Farms Venison is 100% grass-fed &amp;amp; finished, raised

            <g:title>Wild Boar Uncured Maple Slab Bacon</g:title>
            <g:description>Wild boar is leaner and more flavorful than conventional pork, allowing for leaner bacon that
                still possesses a strong flavor. Slab wild boar bacon allows you to cut your own strips of boar bacon as
                thick or as thin as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because wild boar bacon is so much leaner, it has a
                different, meatier texture than conventional bacon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine Magazine
                has called our wild boar “the ultimate sustainable meat” – read the full article.  Unlike much of the
                Wild Boar on the market, ours isn’t farm-raised—it’s truly wild, trapped in the Texas Hill Country.&lt;br
                /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Pork (Wild Boar), Water, Salt, Maple Syrup, Celery Powder, Spices. &lt;br

            <g:title>Wild Boar Boneless Leg</g:title>
            <g:description>Wild boar leg muscles are used a lot during the animal’s life time, particularly on
                wild-caught boar.  This makes their meat too tough for fast cooking methods like grilling, but it also
                gives it incredibly rich flavor.  The solution is to use the meat in slower cooking methods such as
                stewing, slow roasting, or braising which will tenderize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These legs have had
                their bones removed for your convenience, making them much easier to cut into stew meat cubes or carve
                after roasting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine Magazine has called our wild boar “the
                ultimate sustainable meat” – read the full article.  Unlike much of the wild boar on the market, ours
                isn’t farm-raised—it’s truly wild, trapped in the Texas Hill Country.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The
                wildness of true wild boar gives it a distinct game flavor that farm-raised wild boar simply cannot
                match. Although similar to domestic pork and farm-raised wild boar, wild wild boar has a deeper color,
                leaner texture, tighter grain, and bolder taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:description>Wild boar bellies are a fatty cut from the belly of the boar. Bellies (both pork bellies and
                wild boar bellies) are returning to popularity because of their tremendous succulence when braised, slow
                roasted or cured and smoked into bacon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of their genetics &amp;amp;
                wild-ranging lifestyle, wild boar is naturally leaner than pork.  This extends to their belly meat as
                well, which will have less fat than conventional pork bellies.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Food &amp;amp;

            <g:title>Wild Boar Tenderloin</g:title>
            <g:description>Tender, easy to cook, and delicious, wild boar tenderloins are a great way to try this exotic
                game meat for the first time. They&#x27;re delicious marinated, brined, or coated with a spice rub and
                then grilled or roasted.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wild boar&#x27;s flavor is slightly sweet and nutty
                from its diet of foraged nuts and other foods from the forest. The tenderloin comes from the back of the
                boar, running from the shoulder to the leg. Because the boar does not use these muscles very often, the
                meat in wild boar tenderloins is very tender. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine Magazine has
                called our wild boar &quot;the ultimate sustainable meat&quot; – read the full article.  Unlike much of

            <g:description>Pekin ducks (aka Long Island ducklings) are the variety most Americans think of when they
                think of duck meat.  Pekin duck meat tends to be milder than Muscovy or Moulard duck.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br
                /&gt;Pekin duck legs have more robust flavor than the breasts, but need to be slow cooked for
                tenderness.  They are frequently braised or slow-cooked in duck fat to produce duck confit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

            <g:title>Magret Duck Legs</g:title>
            <g:description>Magret duck leg quarters (aka magret leg-thigh combos) each include both the leg and thigh
                attached at the joint.  They are plump with a rich and distinctive flavor. They are well suited to slow
                cooking techniques and are often slow roasted, braised, or cured &amp;amp; simmered in duck fat to make
                duck confit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These duck legs are harvested from Moulard ducks (cross bred from
                Muscovy and Pekin ducks) which are regarded on both sides of the Atlantic as being the domesticated
                breed with the most flavor. Although they have more total fat than a Muscovy duck, under the fat layer
                they are actually on the lean side, so care must be taken not to overcook Magret duck meat.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;These duck legs have been air chilled, a method preferred by chefs because it better
                preserves the bird’s flavor, lets the meat absorb marinades better, doesn’t add water weight, and is
                more environmentally friendly (produces less contaminated water) than water chilling, which is used for
                most poultry.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Duck is beloved in both Europe and China, and its full flavor can
                be paired with sweet, savory and spicy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:description>Foie gras is grouped into three quality grades: A, B &amp;amp; C.  Of these Grade A is the
                finest and perfectly suited to slicing &amp;amp; searing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Duck foie gras is the
                buttery, creamy, soft enlarged liver of a duck (typically the Moulard breed) that has been force fed
                (gavage) a corn mash during the finishing period.  Gavage is an ancient technique dating back to the
                Egyptian and Roman eras (when it was typically done with figs).  This process makes use of the birds’
                natural ability to use their livers to store extra energy (before flying south for the winter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

            <g:title>Sliced Grade B Foie Gras</g:title>
            <g:description>These pre-sliced, individually quick frozen (IQF) pieces of foie gras are extremely easy to
                cook.  Simply sear slices, still frozen, over high heat, for about 2 minutes per side, then serve. &lt;br
                /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Foie gras is grouped into three quality grades: A, B &amp;amp; C.  Grade B foie is not
                as perfect as Grade A, with a softer texture, and may exhibit some light bruising.  It is also likely to
                render out more fat when cooking than Grade A foie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <g:title>French Poulet Rouge™ Chicken</g:title>
            <g:description>Poulet Rouge™ chickens (aka redbro cou nu chicken) are a venerable heritage breed renowned
                for their flavor and their thin skin. Heritage poultry breeds are slower growing than conventional
                chicken, resulting in a far more delicious bird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Poulet Rouge™ chickens are
                raised in North Carolina from Label Rouge breeding stock imported from France.  They are fed a strict
                vegetarian, all-grain diet free from animal byproducts.  They live on small family farms in open-sided
                houses with sunlight, natural ventilation, and access to the outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape
                of a Poulet Rouge™ is significantly different from the chickens you see at the grocery store. Their
                bodies (and thus their breast meat) and legs are longer and less pudgy.  They’re leaner and have a
                richer, fuller flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These birds are hand inspected, selected for premium
                quality and hand processed before being air chilled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Air chilling (as opposed to
                the cheaper and more common industrial water chilling) chickens is a more environmentally sound process
                that generates less waste and further improves the flavor and texture of the bird (water chilled
                chickens absorb undesirable water during the chilling process).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each Poulet
                Rouge™ is large enough to prov(more...)

            <g:title>Whole Quail</g:title>
            <g:description>Quail’s light colored meat is tender and succulent with a delicate, sweet and distinctly
                nutty flavor. The smallest of the game birds, a common single serving of quail is two whole birds. Easy
                to grill or roast whole, they can also be braised, sautéed, or stuffed. They look beautiful on the
                plate.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quail meat is enjoyed in a host of European, Middle Eastern, and even
                Southeast Asian cuisines, and pairs well with a variety of spices and flavors.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These
                quail have been air chilled, a method preferred by chefs because it better preserves the bird’s flavor,
                lets the meat absorb marinades better, doesn’t add water weight, and is more environmentally friendly
                (produces less contaminated water) than water chilling, which is used for most poultry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

            <g:description>Yes, squabs are young pigeons (called pigeonneaux in French). But this noble bird is too
                often dismissed because it shares a name with the pests we see in metropolitan areas. Squab raised for
                human consumption are brought up on farms, as they have been in the Middle East and Asia for ages (squab
                were among the first birds domesticated). This practice has survived since antiquity because of these
                birds’ delicious flavor.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Squab meat is dark - closer in flavor to duck than
                chicken.&amp;nbsp; In addition to being flavorful, it&#x27;s tender, high in protein, and low in fat.&amp;nbsp;
                Squabs are delicious sauteed,&amp;nbsp;roasted or grilled. These birds are already dressed, saving you
                the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

  "title": "Wagyu Beef Outer Skirt Steaks",
  "description": "Skirt steaks are a long, thin cut from the plate primal. They offer bold, beefy flavor at a more affordable price than highly prized ribeyes, tenderloins, etc. Inner skirt steaks are the quintessential fajita cut, while outer skirt steaks are more highly prized and usually served sliced as a center-of-plate steak rather than as an ingredient.Wagyu beef is from a breed of cow specially raised to increase its percentage of fat marbling to consistently high levels. More marbling leads to more flavor, tenderness, and moisture as the fat melts during the cooking process. This wagyu beef is from domestic cattle that are descendants from Japanese herds and raised in the United States. Their intricately marbled beef (commonly known as &quot;Kobe beef&quot;, American Kobe beef or Kobe-style beef) is legendary and the result of careful breeding and a highly regimented diet. That marbling creates beef that is the most tender, juicy, and flavorful available.",

  "description": "Cowboy steaks are bone-in ribeye chops beloved by steak fans for the big bold beefy flavor. The bone has been cleaned of meat &amp; fat (&quot;frenched&quot;) for a more visually impressive presentation. These wagyu cowboy steaks are slightly larger and have a bit more meat compared to a standard ribeye steak. This wagyu beef (aka kobe-style beef) is from a breed of cattle descended from Japanese herds and specially raised in Texas to increase its percentage of fat marbling to consistently high levels.

  "description": "Bison osso bucco is an intensely flavorful cut cross-cut from the leg – a disk of hearty meat around a center piece of marrow bone. It must be slow braised in order to become tender, and is typically served in a sauce made from the braising liquid alongside a starch like polenta, potatoes, or risotto.Bison&#x27;s flavor is often described as a richer version of beef with just a hint of sweetness. It is not gamey at all, and has a deeper red color and coarser grain than beef. <br /> <br />Like many game meats, bison meat is much healthier than conventional grain-fed beef. Its primary health benefits are its low fat content (less than a third as much fat as similar cuts of beef), lower cholesterol (less than skinless chicken) and high amount of iron.

It is extremely well marbled, giving it a particularly sweet &amp; buttery flavor and luxuriously tender, moist texture. <br /> <br />While Campo Iberico pork is superb, Bellota Iberico pork is the best of the best, with many cuts having additional sweet, nutty, luxuriously creamy fat. <br /> <br />100% Iberico Genetics<br /> As any fan of Wagyu or Angus beef will tell you, breed genetics can make a big difference in the quality of the meat. <br /> <br />Bellota – “Acorn Fed”<br /> Not all Iberico pork on the market is acorn fed, but Iberico that is represents the finest quality available. Despite being called “acorn fed” in English, what this actually means is “Acorn Finished” – all Bellota pigs graze on grass, forage, and other things in their pastures (dehesas) until acorn season. <br /> <br />When the acorns start to fall from the trees in October, the pigs love them and eat as many as they can (herders actually help by shaking the branches to knock more acorns down). For each 2.2lbs a pig gains during acorn season, they must eat 13-22lbs of acorns a day, plus 6.6lbs of grass.(more...)",

Ground venison can be used in recipes as you would other ground meats as long as its lower fat content is taken into account. Try it in pasta sauces, sausages, burgers, meatballs, meatloaf blends &amp; more.Silver Fern Farms Venison is 100% grass-fed &amp; finished, raised free range on massive pastures in New Zealand. No hormone or antibiotic growth promotants are ever used, and GMOs are illegal in New Zealand.<br /> <br />It has a luxuriously tender texture (apart from the braising cuts, which must be slow cooked) and a sweet, robust flavor.<br /> <br />This farm raised venison is considered amongst the finest in the world. It is much more tender than wild venison without its intensely gamey flavor. The &quot;Cervena&quot; appellation includes controls to ensure only the finest quality is sold.<br /> <br />Healthy &amp; Exceptionally Lean<br /> Venison has extremely low levels of fat - significantly less than skinless chicken. It is also lower in cholesterol than beef or lamb, while being high in iron and zinc. What fat it has is good fat, with high levels of healthy omega 3 fatty acids.<br /> <br /> <br />",
